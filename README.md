infinitrace
===========

A trace solution for C/C++ code on Linux, optimized for high trace volumes and low latency
The project is derived from the Traces project by Yotam Rubin and other - http://github.com/yotamr/traces
- with many improvements and optimizations for large scale systems.

Most of the documentation for the Traces project also applies here. More specific documentation will be added later.
